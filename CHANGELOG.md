- `account.retrieve()` / `balance()` / `apps()`.
- `webhooks.create()` / `list()` / `deliveries()` / `remove()` / `test()` for webhook subscription management.
- `verifyWebhookSignature()` and `constructWebhookEvent()` helpers (HMAC-SHA256, timing-safe, replay tolerance) available both as standalone exports and on `superchat.webhooks`.
- Automatic `Idempotency-Key` generation for `payments.create()`, plus support for caller-supplied keys.
- Automatic retries with exponential backoff for idempotent requests, `429` and `5xx` responses.
- Typed error hierarchy: `SuperchatError`, `SuperchatConfigError`, `SuperchatAPIError`, `SuperchatConnectionError`, `SuperchatSignatureError`.
- Dual ESM / CommonJS output with TypeScript declarations and source maps.
